![Farewell to all those friends I'm leaving back in Vienna!](/img/news-2019-09-11.jpg)

In September 13th I'll be landing in Argentina to be once again part of PLADEMA, this time as an Assistant Researcher funded by CONICET. 
I'll be joining again Yatiris, a group within PLADEMA developing cutting edge technologies for medical image analysis using computer vision, machine learning and 
pattern recognition techniques. I'll be responsible of coordinating all the deep learning initiatives, while continuing my own line of research in computer-assisted
ophthalmology.

It's hard to say goodbye to OPTIMA and such an amazing group of talents and good people. My time in Vienna was so exciting, full of research
projects from which I learned a lot. 
I would like to thank Prof. Schmidt-Erfurth for trusting in me for this position, and also to Bianca Gerendas, Hrvoje BogunoviÄ‡, Sebastian Waldstein
and Martin Ehler for their continuous support. I would also like to thank all of my colleagues in the lab, specially Philipp, Dominik, Antoine, 
Wolf, Rhona, David, Thomas and Sophie. Some of them have turned into really good friends of mine that I will miss a lot being abroad!

That being said, I'm glad to move back to Argentina to give back to the country at least a little bit in proportion to what it did to me since I was born there :)
