Yesterday, September 21th 2017, I have officially defended my PhD thesis!! It was entitled "Machine learning for ophthalmic screening and diagnostics from fundus images". You can find its English version [here](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/592162/1/tesis.pdf), and the Spanish version [here](http://www.ridaa.unicen.edu.ar/xmlui/handle/123456789/1476). Most of the code of each of the contributions is available on my github profile. Feel free to clone the repositories and experiment with them!
