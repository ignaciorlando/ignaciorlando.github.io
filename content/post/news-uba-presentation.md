![Presentation](/img/headers/uba-presentation.jpg)

In December 7th I gave a lecture on machine learning for ophthalmic image analysis at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA, Argentina).
This talk was part of the closure event of the "Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis" course that [Enzo Ferrante](https://eferrante.github.io/)
taught at the Faculty of Exact Sciences. Thanks Enzo for the invitation!
