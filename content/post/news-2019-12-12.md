!["What's next in AI for glaucoma screening? The REFUGE challenge outcomes"](/img/headers/presentation_image_ai.jpg)

In December 12th I participated (remotely) as a lecturer at [IMAGE AI](https://www.eugs.org/newsletter/newsletter-2019-11/IMAGE_AI.htm), an international meeting on artificial intelligence and its application to glaucoma, organized by the European Glaucoma Society in collaboration with researchers from UZ Leuven and VITO. I was invited to present the results of the challenge REFUGE, in whose organization I participated during my postdoc in Austria. [The slides can be found here](https://ignaciorlando.github.io/static/ImageAI2019_alternative.pptx). This work is a collaboration between Yanwu Xu, Hrvoje BogunoviÄ‡, Huazhu Fu, Xiualn Zhang, Fei Li and the REFUGE team.
