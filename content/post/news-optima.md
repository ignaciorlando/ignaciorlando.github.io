I'm glad to tell you, guys, that since next week I will be formally part of the [Christian Doppler Laboratory for Ophthalmic Image Analysis (OPTIMA)](https://optima.meduniwien.ac.at/), a multidisciplinary research team that belongs to the Department of Ophthalmology and Optometry of the Medical University of Vienna (Austria). I'm joining the laboratory as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, working on automated OCT image analysis using deep learning techniques. My research will be funded by the project WWTF AugUniWien / FA746A0249. I'm really looking forward to start to work with this amazing team!
