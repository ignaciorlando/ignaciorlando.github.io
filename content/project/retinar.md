Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of preventable blindness in working age populations. Color fundus photography is currently used for telemedicine campaigns in which diabetic patients are remotely screened once an year through this imaging modality. The images are acquired by trained technicians, who transfer them to a study center in which retina experts analyzed them to determine the diagnostic. When the amount of patients increases, so does the number of images to analyze. As a consequence, these platforms suffer from scalability issues, which seriously affect their accuracy and efficiency.

In this project we aim to develop an AI-assisted platform to allow for efficient screening of diabetic retinopathy. Our system will use deep learning techniques to ensure capturing high quality photographs in the acquisitions centers and to provide early diagnostics to the patients. It will also feature lesion detections modules that will be used by the ophthalmologists to produce more accurate reports.
