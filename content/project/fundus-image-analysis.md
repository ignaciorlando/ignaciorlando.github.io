Fundus photography is a low cost medical imaging technique that allows to assess the retina non-invasively.
As part of this project we develop automated tools based on deep learning and image processing techniques to aid clinicians in low cost screening of retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.
We have created methods for automatically segmenting red lesions in diabetic retinopathy cases and for characterizing the hemodynamics of the retinal arteroles. We also developed tools for automated glaucoma detection and to identify proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
