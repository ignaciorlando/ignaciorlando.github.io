Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a 3D non-invasive imaging technique that allows to inspect the retina at a micrometric resolution.
It is widely applied in ophthalmology for diagnosis and treatment planning of several diseases, including diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion and age-related macular degeneration.
In this project we are focused in introducing automated techniques for precision medicine based in this imaging modality. To this end, we develop methods for characterizing the status of the photoreceptors and to segment lesions and other abnormalities.
