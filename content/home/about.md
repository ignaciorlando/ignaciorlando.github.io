# Biography
Hi there! I'm José Ignacio Orlando, but you can call me Nacho :)
I'm currently an Assistant Researcher from [CONICET](http://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en), working as part of Yatiris lab at the [PLADEMA Institute](http://www.pladema.net/) ([UNICEN](https://www.unicen.edu.ar/english) - [CIC-PBA](https://www.gba.gob.ar/cic) - [CNEA](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/comision-nacional-de-energia-atomica), Tandil, Argentina).
Apart from PLADEMA (where I did my PhD from 2013 to 2017), my previous affiliations include the [Center for Learning and Visual Computing](http://cvn.centralesupelec.fr) in Paris, France (2013, 6 months working as an intern funded by [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/galen)), [ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) in [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium (2016, 1 month working as a visiting scholar) and the [Christian Doppler Laboratory for Ophthalmic Image Analysis (OPTIMA)](https://optima.meduniwien.ac.at/) from the [Medical University of Vienna](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/hp/1/department-of-ophthalmology/), Austria (2018-2019, almost 2 years working as a postdoctoral researcher).
I hold a PhD in Computational and Industrial Mathematics. I'm also a Software Engineer, and I'm passionate about interdisciplinary research at the intersection of medicine and computer science. My main research interests involve the application of machine learning and computer vision techniques to process biomedical signals, with applications to ophthalmology and medicine in general.
