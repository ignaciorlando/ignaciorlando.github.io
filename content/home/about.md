# Biography
Hi there! I'm José Ignacio Orlando, but everyone call me Nacho :)

I'm an Assistant Researcher at [CONICET](http://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en), working as part of [Yatiris lab](http://yatiris.github.io/) at [Pladema Institute](http://www.pladema.net/) in Tandil, Argentina.

My main research interests include machine learning and computer vision techniques for medical imaging applications, mostly centered in ophthalmology.

Apart from PLADEMA (where I did my PhD from 2013 to 2017), my previous affiliations include the [Center for Learning and Visual Computing](http://cvn.centralesupelec.fr) in Paris, France (2013, 6 months working as an intern funded by [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/galen)), [ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) in [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium (2016, 1 month working as a visiting scholar) and the [Christian Doppler Laboratory for Ophthalmic Image Analysis (OPTIMA)](https://optima.meduniwien.ac.at/) from the [Medical University of Vienna](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/hp/1/department-of-ophthalmology/), Austria (2018-2019, almost 2 years working as a postdoctoral researcher).
