# Biography
Hi everyone! I'm José Ignacio Orlando, but you can call me Nacho :)
I'm an Argentinian researcher currently working as a postdoc in the [Christian Doppler Laboratory for Ophthalmic Image Analysis (OPTIMA)](https://optima.meduniwien.ac.at/), at the [Medical University of Vienna](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/hp/1/department-of-ophthalmology/) (Austria). In 2013 I've received my Software Engineering degree from [UNICEN](https://www.unicen.edu.ar/english) (Tandil, Argentina), and in September 2017 I've defended my PhD thesis in Computational and Industrial Mathematics in the same university. I've done my doctoral research at the [PLADEMA Institute](http://www.pladema.net/) with a PhD scholarship granted by [CONICET](http://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en), and supervised by [Prof. Dr. Matthew B. Blaschko](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~mblaschk/) ([ESAT-PSI](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi), [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium) and [Prof. Dr. Mariana del Fresno](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mariana_Del_Fresno) ([CIC-PBA](https://www.gba.gob.ar/cic), UNICEN, Tandil, Argentina). My main research interests involve the application of machine learning and computer vision techniques for ophthalmic image analysis.
